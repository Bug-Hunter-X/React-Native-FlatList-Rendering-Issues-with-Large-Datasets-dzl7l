This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets. The bug causes incorrect rendering of list items, with some items disappearing or appearing in the wrong positions during scrolling.  The solution involves correctly implementing the `keyExtractor` prop and optionally `getItemLayout` to improve rendering performance and accuracy.  This example provides clear illustrations of the problem and its solution.
